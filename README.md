# TSM Desktop Application

[The TSM Desktop Application (aka the "TSM App")](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/app/overview) acts a bridge between
the TradeSkillMaster website and addons. If you are simply interested in using this program, you should
[download it from the official TSM website](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/app/overview).

## Building

The TSM App is written using the following software:
 - Python 3.4.3
 - PyQt 5.5.1

In the root of the repository is a `make.py` script which implements a very basic system. Simply running it without any
arguments will build and run the application.
